  abstract =	 {The application of machine learning to the
                  prediction of molecular and materials properties has
                  become very fashionable in the last few years. In
                  fact, machine-learning techniques have been used for
                  a long time, called by more specific names such as
                  clustering or dimensionality reduction, to provide a
                  simplified, coarse-grained representation of the
                  structure and dynamics of complex systems, from
                  proteins to nanoparticles. This perspective briefly
                  reviews some of the traditional approaches, seen in
                  relation to the fundamental mathematical concepts
                  that underlie machine-learning techniques. It
                  discusses how the interplay between data-driven
                  predictions and configurational coarse-graining can
                  be used to rationalize structure-property relations
                  in complex atomistic problems, and to reduce the
                  risk of falling prey to preconceived biases. Current
                  developments in the field suggest that using
                  different classes of machine-learning schemes
                  side-by-side and in a fully integrated mode, while
                  keeping in mind the relations between the data
                  analysis framework and the fundamental physical
                  principles, will be key for realizing the full
                  potential of these methods in the context of
                  atomic-scale simulations.},

  abstract =	 {We revisit the bias-variance tradeoff for neural
                  networks in light of modern empirical findings. The
                  traditional bias-variance tradeoff in machine
                  learning suggests that as model capacity grows, bias
                  decreases and variance increases.  In contrast, we
                  find that both bias and variance can decrease with
                  the number of parameters. To better understand this,
                  we decompose the total variance into variance due to
                  training set sampling and variance due to
                  initialization.  Surprisingly, variance due to
                  training set sampling is roughly constant with both
                  network width and depth, in the over-parameterized
                  setting. We provide theoretical analysis, in a
                  simplified setting inspired by linear models, that
                  is consistent with our empirical findings.},

                  descriptor selection methods and benchmarks, and it

  abstract =	 {Training machine learning based interatomic
                  potentials often requires thousands of first
                  principles calculations, severely limiting their
                  practical application. We present an adaptive
                  Bayesian inference method for automating and
                  accelerating the on-the-fly construction of accurate
                  interatomic force fields from a single molecular
                  dynamics simulation. Within an online active
                  learning algorithm, the internal uncertainty of a
                  Gaussian process regression model is used to decide
                  whether to accept the model prediction or to perform
                  a first principles calculation. This approach
                  provides several orders of magnitude acceleration of
                  molecular dynamics simulations dominated by rare
                  events, using minimal amounts of first-principles
                  data to rapidly and automatically train highly
                  accurate multi-body force fields that are
                  competitive with state-of-the-art classical and
                  machine learned potentials.},

                  proliferating recently within the computational
                  materials science and catalysis fields. This
                  proliferation has spurned the creation of various
                  frameworks for automated materials screening,
                  discovery, and design. Underpinning all these
                  frameworks are surrogate models with uncertainty
                  estimates on their predictions. These uncertainty
                  estimates are instrumental for determining which
                  materials to screen next, but there is not yet a
                  standard procedure for judging the quality of such
                  uncertainty estimates objectively. Here we present a
                  suite of figures and performance metrics that can be
                  used to judge the quality of such uncertainty
                  estimates. This suite probes the accuracy,
                  calibration, and sharpness of a model
                  quantitatively. We then show a case study where we
                  judge various methods for predicting
                  density-functional-theory-calculated adsorption
                  energies. Of the methods studied here, we find that
                  the best performer is a model where a convolutional
                  neural network is used to supply features to a
                  Gaussian process regressor, which then makes
                  predictions of adsorption energies along with
                  corresponding uncertainty estimates.},

  journal =	 {CoRR},

  abstract =	 {Machine learning is becoming an increasingly
                  powerful tool for physics research. High-dimensional
                  physics problems are generally modelled by neural
                  networks (NNs). However, NNs require large data and
                  are problem-specific. An alternative approach is
                  probabilistic modelling based on Gaussian processes
                  (GPs), which are system-agnostic and can be fully
                  automated. However, GPs suffer from the numerical
                  complexity and have been limited to low-dimensional
                  physics problems. Here, we illustrate that it is
                  possible to build an accurate GP model of a
                  51-dimensional physical system based on $5000$
                  inputs, using the fragmentation of the input space
                  and entropy-based enhancement of the model
                  complexity. We demonstrate the potency of these
                  algorithms by constructing the global potential
                  energy surface (PES) for a molecular system with
                  $19$ atoms.  We illustrate that GP models thus
                  constructed have generalization power, allowing us
                  to extrapolate the PES from low energies ($$<$
                  10,000$ cm$^{-1}$), yielding a PES at high energies
                  ($> 20,000$ cm$^{-1}$). This opens the prospect for
                  building machine-learning models that can be used to
                  search for new physics, such as phase transitions,
                  in high-dimensional physics problems with unknown
                  property landscapes by extrapolation.},

                  mechanical simulations has enabled the field to
                  efficiently and accurately study material and
                  molecular systems. Developed models typically rely
                  on a substantial amount of data to make reliable
                  predictions of the potential energy landscape or
                  careful active learning and uncertainty
                  estimates. When starting with small datasets,
                  convergence of active learning approaches is a major
                  outstanding challenge which limited most
                  demonstrations to online active learning. In this
                  work we demonstrate a $\Delta$-machine learning
                  approach that enables stable convergence in offline
                  active learning strategies by avoiding unphysical
                  configurations. We demonstrate our framework's
                  capabilities on a structural relaxation, transition
                  state calculation, and molecular dynamics
                  simulation, with the number of first principle
                  calculations being cut down anywhere from 70-90
                  \%. The approach is incorporated and developed
                  alongside AMPtorch, an open-source machine learning
                  potential package, along with interactive Google
                  Colab notebook examples.},

                  predictors that have recently achieved impressive
                  performance on a wide spectrum of tasks.
                  Quantifying predictive uncertainty in NNs is a
                  challenging and yet unsolved problem. Bayesian NNs,
                  which learn a distribution over weights, are
                  currently the state-of-the-art for estimating
                  predictive uncertainty; however these require
                  significant modifications to the training procedure
                  and are computationally expensive compared to
                  standard (non-Bayesian) NNs. We propose an
                  alternative to Bayesian NNs that is simple to
                  implement, readily parallelizable, requires very
                  little hyperparameter tuning, and yields high
                  quality predictive uncertainty estimates. Through a
                  series of experiments on classification and
                  regression benchmarks, we demonstrate that our
                  method produces well-calibrated uncertainty
                  estimates which are as good or better than
                  approximate Bayesian NNs. To assess robustness to
                  dataset shift, we evaluate the predictive
                  uncertainty on test examples from known and unknown
                  distributions, and show that our method is able to
                  express higher uncertainty on out-of-distribution
                  examples. We demonstrate the scalability of our
                  method by evaluating predictive uncertainty
                  estimates on ImageNet.},
